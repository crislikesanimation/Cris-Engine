# More Information on Contributing to Cris-Engine

## Branches idk kade u know this i dont use github very much
`stable` is the repository's main branch, so people can clone a stable Kade Engine to work on their mods. However, this means that Pull Requests will default to merge into
`stable` instead of `master`.

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER. lollol 
### as u know i just embarassed myself for LITERALLY EDITING A KADE FILE NOT MY FILE A
### anyways if u contribute ty and also dont be lazy and add one thing be like no more contributing and it crashes the whole engine like please?
### If your pull request changes the website, it merges into STABLE.
